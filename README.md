# Singh code book decypher
Some doodles and fiddling in Rust with samples from Simon Singh's "Code Book". I thoroughly enjoy reading his work and
at the example in chapter 1 I felt the itch to write some code in order to do the decoding. It all started unwrapping in
my head and since I like exercising in Rust I thought I'd give it a go.
